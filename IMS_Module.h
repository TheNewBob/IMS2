 /**
 * \brief A physical component of a spacecraft that can be added or removed at runtime
 *
 * The Module class is the heart of IMS2: It manages Attachment points and Mesh placement and
 * transformation, and contains one or several ModuleFunction objects as required to adapt
 * to the demanded functionality. However, while Modules can be added or removed to a vessel
 * at will, a module instance itself is static in terms of capability for the duration of its
 * lifetime, as defined by a config file.
 * A Module is never destroyed, unless the containing vessel is destroyed. If a Module changes ownership,
 * its overall state and the overall state of its functions are unaffected.
 * 
 * A Module is also an EventHandler that provides a throughput eventpipe from the vessel to the modulefunctions.
 * The EventPipe back from a modulefunction however is passed to all other module functions INSIDE THIS MODULE,
 * and are only passed down to the vessel if the module takes action to do so.

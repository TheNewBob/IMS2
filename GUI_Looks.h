/**
 * \file GUI_Looks.h
 * IMS2 has a dynamic style managment with the aim to be able to define UI skins in external files to allow modding,
 * as well as to allow switching skins on the fly during the simulation, or choosing different skins for different 
 * vessels etc.
 * A bit of infrastructure is still missing to accomplish these goals, but what's already here is designed with it in mind.
 *
 * When working with styles and fonts, it is important not to think of something like CSS. The IMS2 interface is static in every important sense
 * of the word, as are all Game interfaces I know of: They are pre-rendered to increase performance, and the layout is hard-coded and cannot
 * be changed. What can be adjusted with styling is really just the outer skin: Colors, fonts and shapes, though the later only in the
 * very limited capacity of which corners should be rounded by how many pixel.
 *
 * Individual Fonts and styles are identified by the string and GUI_FONTS enumerations in GUI_common.h. These identifiers must be used
 * to identify every single style and font in existance, otherwise they will not be changeable by external files.
 * A StyleSet should be thought of as a skin, and is a collection of one of each of these styles and fonts. StyleSets in turn are 
 * managed by the GUI_Looks singleton, which defines all skins avalable in the simulation, and which is the only place fonts and styles
 * should be obtained by the factory functions in GUIentity

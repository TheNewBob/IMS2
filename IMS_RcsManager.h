 * \brief Manages and controls RCS thrusters.

 * Rcs behavior is controlled according to a pretty complex solution that tries to get induce as little secondary effects
 * as possible, no matter where the thrusters are located. If your design is extremely bad this might simply not be possible,
 * but in general it works pretty nicely.
 * This way of doing things requires that the rcs thrusters actually not be part of a thruster group. The levels of the 
 * individual thrusters are controlled directly. This in turn means that there have to be virtual thrusters created
 * to fill up the standard rotation and translation thruster groups, as it would otherwise be impossible to read 
 * the user input to these thrusters.

/**
 * \brief This class contains static orbiter related properties that are common to all modules. 
 *
 * <h3> Config file structure </h3> 
 * brackets are part of the actual synthax, so don't write them. Here's a little explanation of how this documentation is to be read:
 * \code
 * parameter = <argument1> <argument2> <...>	//every parameter has a name, and usually takes one or multiple arguments that are delimited by a space.
 * <type name>									//<> brackets signify an expected argument to a parameter, its expected type and what it is for. 
 * [Optional]									//Anything in [] is optional and must not necessarily be there for a config to work.
 *												//Or in other words, anything not in [] must be there, or there will be errors!
 * \endcode
 *
 * <h4> Required Orbiter native parameters</h4>
 * The following parameters are standard orbiter config parameters, but they must be defined
 * for every module in order to ensure proper functioning!
 * \code
 * module = IMS2									//the orbiter module MUST be defined as the FIRST entry in a config file, and the only valid value for an IMS2 module is IMS2.
 * inertia = <float x> <float y> <float z>			//inertia tensors of the module, mass-normalised. Basically, how difficult it is to turn the module in the given axis. See Orbiter config documentation for details.
 * size = <float>									//mean radius of the module in meters. This is used by orbiter for determining clipping pane of camera and similar.
 
 *
 * <h4> hull shapes </h4>
 * Note that transformations will always be applied in the below order, even if you don't write them in this order in the config.
 * \code
 * [BEGIN_SHAPE
 *		shape = <shapetype> <VECTOR3 shaapeparams>			//see below for details
 *		[offset] = <VECTOR3>								//moves the shape out of the center. Use this if the mesh of your module does not have its center at 0 0 0
 *		[scale] = <VECTOR3>									//non-uniform scaling on x y and z. Use this if the basic shapes are not enough to adequately approximate
 *															//the modules shape (flatened cylinder, oblong spheroid or somesuch).
 *		[orientation] = <VECTOR3 dir>, <VECTOR3 rot> 		//rotates the shape to the given orientation, under the assumption that the original alignment is 0 0 1, 0 1 0.
 *															//Use this to rotate a shape to fit the orientation of the mesh.
 * END_SHAPE]
 * \endcode
 *
 * <p>
 * Defines a coarse hullshape for the module. This data will be used by IMS to generate touchdown points.
 * Note that this can get expensive for large vessels, so it makes sense to only use this parameter
 * on modules that will make up significant parts of a vessels structures. It should not be used for
 * small things like RCS thrusters or small propellant tanks.
 * </p>
 * <h4> valid shape parameters </h4>
 * \code
 *	shape = box <x y z>								//Creates a box with dimensions x y z (meters) with the center at 0 0 0
 *	shape = cylinder <radius length segments>		//Creates a cylinder aligned with the z-axis and its center at 0 0 0. radius and 
 *													//length are given in meters. segments denotes the number of radial segments.
 *													//This must be an even number, >= 6, and I see no reason why it should ever be 
 *													//larger than 12, usually 8. You're playing with peoples framerate here!
 *	shape = sphere <radius segments unused>			//Creates a sphere with its center at 0 0 0. The same guidelines apply for segments
 *													//as do for cylinders, but more so. The third value of the vector is unused, but must be there none the less!
 * \endcode
 *
 *	Example: Create a cylinder with a radius of 3 meters, a length of 12 m, offset from the center by -2 meters in the z axis.
 * \code 
 * BEGIN_SHAPE
 *		shape = cylinder 3 12 8
 *		offset 0 0 -2
 * END_SHAPE
 * \endcode	
 *
 * <h4> attachment points </h4>
 * \code
 * BEGIN_IMS_ATTACHMENT
 *	<position>, <direction>, <rotation>, <attachment-type>		//see below for detailed description
 *		.
 *		.
 * END_IMS_ATTACHMENT 
 * \endcode
 * <p>
 * Define an arbitrary number of IMS attachment points. Attachment points will manifest on the module as docking ports, until another module
 * Is integrated on that point, then the Dockport will vanish.
 * </p>
 * \code
 * position: <VECTOR3>								//The position of the attachment point in meters, relative to 0 0 0 of the mesh.
 * direction: <VECTOR3>								//The facing ("forward") of the attachment point as a normalised vector.
 * rotation: <VECTOR3>								//The rotation ("up") of the attachment point as a normalised vector. MUST be perpendicular to direction, or bad things will happen!
 * attachment-type: <string>						//A string identifier for the "type" of the attachment point. Only attachment points with matching types can be assembled.
 * \endcode
 * 
 * Example: Creates two attachment points on a module, one facing forward aligned with the module, the other backwards and "on its head".
 * \code
 * BEGIN_IMS_ATTACHMENT
 *		0 0 6,     0  0  1,    0  1  0, 	IMS2_DEFAULT
 *		0 0 -6,    0  0  -1,   0  -1  0, 	IMS2_DEFAULT
 * END_IMS_ATTACHMENT
 * \endcode

<div class="textblock"><p>General description of the Event engine</p>
<p>This event engine is built around two core principles: Provide clear and seperable lines of communication through a program, while being easy and effortless to work with once those lines are laied out. Besides that it also had to be flexible enough to easily sever and reestablish its lines of communication without complication. This goal is achieved by a three component architecture:</p>
<p>EventHandlers are the base class from which classes that need to send or receive events have to derive. This base class provides an interface to create EventGenerators and Sinks and connect as well as disconnect them, and to generate events for the appropriate event pipes. The <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> class also manages the different event pipes running through it, although this doesn't need further input after laying out the initial lines of communication. The most visible function of the <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> interface is to provide an overloadable ProcessEvent() function, which provides a central hub for a derived class to handle its events. All events passing through the <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a>, no matter what pipe they belong to, will pass through this method.</p>
<p>EventGenerators take on events and process them according to their properties. Depending on an events delay, the generator will either send an event down its pipe immediately or add it to an eventqueue that is worked off at every call to sendEvents() of its containing <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> instance. EventGenerators should always be created, connected and used through the interface of the <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> class, not directly.</p>
<p>EventSinks are connected to event generators or other event sinks with the sole purpose of passing events down an event pipe and passing them to the ProcessEvent() function of their hosting <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> instance. They are themselves unable to generate events. EventSinks should always be created, connected and used through the interface provided by the <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a> class, not directly.</p>
<p>The Event Pipe is the concept connecting these components together. An event pipe is not a class and doesn't exist as a formulated structure in the code. It is an identifer that tells event generators and event sinks which line of communication they belong to. As a concept, an event pipe is a tree with one or several EventGenerators at its root (see below), branching out into an arbitrary number of event sinks all belonging to the same event pipe. When an <a class="el" href="class_event_generator.html" title="EventGenerators take on events, equip them with additional information about the sender, and process them according to their urgency. ">EventGenerator</a> is told to generate an event, it will send that event to all event sinks that are connected to it. These sinks in turn will first send the event to the ProcessEvent() function of their <a class="el" href="class_event_handler.html" title="EventHandler base class. All classes that implement eventhandling must inherit from this class...">EventHandler</a>, and then onwards to their own child sinks. EventHandlers can choose to consume an event, in which case the propagation is stopped. Event Pipes are uni-directional: The event travels upwards from the generator, triggering all EventHandlers on its path, and returning true or false to signify consumption. Bi-directional communication therefore requires two event pipes.</p>
<p>It is possible, and often necessary, for an event pipe to have several eventgenerators. I.E. the tree has several roots. For example, if a class "Container" has a collection of class instances of class "child", and the children need to send events to the Container, it makes sense for them to all use the same event pipe. Except of course they are all using their own event generator. In these situations the important thing is that that all these generators connect to the same sink, So the path of the event is the same no matter where the event comes from. Imagine a tree that has one stem (the first eventsink in the pipe), and branches out towards the top (further event sinks up the tree), but also branches at the root (multiple event generators connecting to the "stem"). It's not strictly a tree in terms of data structures, but it's pretty close to a real tree, so it shouldn't be difficult to imagine. Just keep in mind that the communication is still uni-directional, i.e. the event ALWAYS travels from root to top. </p>

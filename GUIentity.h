/**
* \brief Abstract class providing functionality to create and manage GUI elements.
*
* The GUIentity stores GUIelements in a tree that describes a menu structure. It is capable of handling
* several such trees, so it needn't be restricted to one root. It has random access
* to all of its decendants and is a single point of entry to create new GUI elements and directly insert
* them into the proper tree using the uid of a parent.
* If elements are created dynamically (i.e. without a set uid), the GUIentity will automatically assign them
* one. UIDs of elements are LOCAL to the GUIentity managing them. Different GUIentities can have elements of
* the same UID, provided every UID only appears once in every GUIentity.
